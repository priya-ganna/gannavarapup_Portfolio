## Projects
1.	_A Survey on Consumer Perspective Towards Environmental Friendly Products:_ Utilized statistical tools, including SPSS and chi-square tests, to assess consumer attitudes toward eco-friendly products among 150 respondents. Gained proficiency in primary data collection, descriptive analysis, and hypothesis testing to draw insights about sustainable product adoption and awareness levels across demographics.

2.	_Predicting Prospective Customer’s Satisfaction on Airlines:_ Applied data preprocessing techniques (outlier detection, missing value imputation) and statistical analysis (t-tests) to a large airline customer dataset.  Built and compared multiple machine learning models in R to predict customer satisfaction and identify key influencing factors.

3.	_Computational Statistics:_ Applied data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering to clean and structure a large dataset of 129K for predictive modeling. Leveraged logistic regression and statistical tests to analyze airline customer satisfaction, achieving an accuracy of 83.4% and deriving insights for targeted marketing strategies.

4.	_Applied Statistics:_ Implemented various data science techniques using R for predictive analytics and statistical modeling: Logistic regression for binary classification (Downer dataset). Polynomial regression with 10-fold cross-validation to optimize model degree selection (Faithful dataset). Lasso regression for feature selection and regression modeling, leveraging cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning (Boston dataset). Conducted exploratory data analysis and variable importance assessment.

5.	_Application Name: Customer – Order:_ Developed a Flask-based web application integrating SQLite for database management. Implemented modular customer and order CRUD functionalities with templates and routes. Enhanced scalability through database normalization and user access management. Delivered features like sales reports, inventory checks, and real-time notifications.

6.	_Predictive Modelling of NYC Yellow Cab Trip Duration:_ A Machine Learning Approach: Preprocessed and engineered spatial-temporal features from NYC Taxi Trip data for regression modeling. Utilized Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, optimized via hyperparameter tuning, to predict trip durations with minimal error (MAE and RMSE). Integrated Python libraries (Tkinter, Pandas, Scikit-Learn) to design an interactive GUI, showcasing model outputs and key dataset insights.

7.	_Statistical Learning:_ Applied statistical learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, to solve a binary classification problem. Utilized R for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering (log transformations, interaction terms), and performance assessment through confusion matrices and cross-validation. Gained proficiency in model evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and AUC, for optimizing predictive analysis, achieving up to 98.67% accuracy.

8.	_Deep learning for automated brain tumor diagnosis: Detection, Classification and Localization -_ Implemented and optimized deep learning models (CNN, U-Net, ResNet50, VGG19) for brain tumor classification and segmentation from MRI data. Processed and normalized data from 7022 MRI scans into tumor classes; trained models with evaluation metrics including accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices. Enhanced model performance through architectural selection (e.g., VGG19's depth and ResNet50's residual learning) to address vanishing gradient issues and improve scalability.

9.	_Fake News Detection:_ Applied advanced machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and natural language processing (TF-IDF, bi-grams) for fake news detection. Utilized Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, NLTK, and SpaCy for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. Demonstrated proficiency in model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score, while implementing ensemble methods to enhance predictive accuracy.

10.	 _Secure Cloud-Based Healthcare Database:_ Applied AES-256 and RSA encryption techniques to secure healthcare data, including gender, age, and SSNs, while enabling privacy-preserving queries. Developed Order Preserving Encryption (OPE) for range queries on encrypted weight data, balancing usability and security. Designed and implemented user authentication, access control, and data integrity mechanisms using Python and SQL for a secure database-as-a-service system.

11.	 _Performance Analysis of Original and Extended Neural Networks on MNIST Dataset:_ Designed, implemented, and evaluated a neural network extension for the MNIST dataset by integrating an additional hidden layer with ReLU activation. Adjusted forward and backward propagation, optimized parameters (learning rate 0.1; 490 iterations), and analyzed results using loss/accuracy plots. Achieved 85.3% accuracy with improved generalization and learning capacity over the baseline model.
